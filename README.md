# SVG-Parser-and-WebGL-Visualizer
Hello there! I'm Jose Manuel, an undergraduate student at WPI, and I've created a WebGL project that allows you to upload SVG files and visualize them in a web-based environment. Here's how you can interact with it:

- Upload an SVG File: Click the "Add" button to select an SVG file from your device.

- Rotate the Image: You can rotate the displayed image using the scroll wheel. Scroll up to rotate clockwise, and scroll down to rotate counterclockwise.

- Scale the Image: To scale the image, hold down the "Shift" key and scroll up to zoom in or scroll down to zoom out.

- Move the Image: You can move the image around by clicking and dragging it with your mouse.

- Reset Image Position: If you want to reset the image to its original position, simply press the "r" key on your keyboard.

This project combines SVG parsing and WebGL rendering to provide an interactive and visually appealing way to work with SVG files. Give it a try and explore your SVG graphics!
